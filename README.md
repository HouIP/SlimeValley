# Slime Valley

**Slime Valley** is an immersive VR sandbox experience set in a fantasy café. The project focuses on physics interactions and spatial audio to create a relaxing "whimsical wonderland" where users can escape reality and play with adorable slimes.

## 🎮 Key Features & Interactions

* **Dynamic Slime Interaction:** Pick up slimes using ray or direct interaction. You can feed them hotdogs (eating sounds) or bananas (toggle slimes gravity).
* **Two-Handed Transformation:** Physically grab a slime with both hands to stretch it larger or pinch it smaller. The slime's audio pitch changes dynamically based on its size.
* **Gadgets & Tools:**
  * **Slime Blaster:** Load multiple foods or slimes into a gun and launch them.
  * **Dispensers:** Spawn specific food or random slimes (with a rare chance for a King Slime).
  * **Slime Bat:** Hit a slime to split it into two smaller half-sized slimes.
  * **Locomotion:** Toggle between teleportation and continuous movement based on comfort preference.
